What my project is:
My project is called Games4U and it is a website that puts games together in a website for viewers to play. The games available are Tic Tac Toe, Rock Paper Scissors, Memory, and Snake.

Why I made it:
It's nice to be able to have an easy-to-navigate website to play the most common games! I also wanted to learn how to make interactive projects using JavaScript as I normally don't make projects like this.

How I made it:
I used HTML and CSS for the design and hovering effects. I also used JavaScript which makes up most of the game features.

What I struggled with/learned:
It was challenging to learn JavaScript and make multiple fully functioning games but the process was fun.
